#GameOfLife
Conway's Game Of Life, written in C. Will be expanded to work with MPI, OpenMP and CUDA.

Branches:

master - This is a simple implementation of Conway's game of life

MPI - Conway's game of life modified so that it uses MPI

MPI_Allreduce - Same as MPI, but with an Allreduce check every 10 iterations for changes in the grid

MPI_OpenMP - Hybrid MPI/OpenMP implementation
